figure it oout yourself my lad,
you've all that the greatest of men have had,
Two arm,two legs and a brain to use if you're wise.
With this eqipment they all began,So start now for the top and say i can.

Look them over ,the wise and great
They take their food from a common plate.
And similar spoon and fork tey use.
With similar lases they tie their shoes.
The world considers them brave and smart.
But you've all they had when they all began

You can triumph and come to skill.
You can be great if you only will.
you're well equipped for what fight you choose.
And the man who has risen great deeds to do
Began his life with no more than you.

You are the handicap you must face
you are the one who must choose your place
You must say where you want to go
How much you will study the truth to know
God has equipped you for life but he
lets you decide what you want to be 

Courage must come from the soul within
The man must furnish the will to win.
So figure it out yourself my lad.
You are born with all that the great have had
With your eqipmennt they all began.
Get hold of yourself andsay i can
